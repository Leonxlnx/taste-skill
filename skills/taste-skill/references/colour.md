# Colour

The direction sheet deals a palette with named roles. This file is how to apply it so the page looks
decided rather than tinted.

## 1. What the study measured

- 41% of the studied pages are dark, 59% light. A quarter sit on pure white; 12% on pure black.
- Schemes, as the panel classed them: monochrome plus one accent 23%, light neutral 22%, dark neutral
  14%, several flat colours 13%, strictly two-tone 12%, colour carried by photographs 9%, one saturated
  field 6%.
- Buttons are neutral (black, white, grey) on 52% of sites. A coloured button is a choice, not a
  requirement.
- Gradient fills appear on 22% of the top-scored sites and 52% of the weak ones; gradient text on 2%
  against 13%.
- One site in 246 has a terracotta primary button and none has a violet one. Those are colours of
  generated pages, not of the gallery. Warm off-white grounds do occur (32 sites), nearly always with
  a dark or green ink rather than an orange accent.
- Top-scored sites change the page's field colour between sections more often (a median of two section
  grounds against one).

## 2. The roles

```css
:root {
  --bg: …;          /* the ground: most of the surface */
  --surface: …;     /* a clear step from the ground: cards, panels, the bar's panel, form fields */
  --ink: …;         /* main text and the strongest marks */
  --muted: …;       /* secondary text; passes contrast on --bg and on --surface */
  --accent: …;      /* the one accent */
  --accent-ink: …;  /* text on the accent */
  /* --field-1 … --field-n and their inks, when the palette has section fields */
}
```

Use the tokens for every colour in the build. A raw hex in a component is a second palette starting.
Do not add greys between the roles: if you need a quieter text, it is `--muted`; if you need a quieter
surface, it is `--surface`.

## 3. Proportion

Decide the shares before colouring anything and check them in the screenshot:

- **Ground:** 70–90% of the page.
- **Ink:** text and perhaps one inverted section (ink as ground, ground as ink).
- **Accent:** under 5% of any screen. It marks the action and at most one other recurring thing. The
  moment it appears in five places it stops meaning "here".

Palettes with fields (flat-loud, pastel) are dealt only to bold or playful pages, with two fields at
most, the ink and the accent: each of those sections is one field at full strength and the proportion
rule applies inside it (field, its ink, nothing else).

The accent is not for headings, icons, bullets, borders or underlines unless the direction sheet says
so. A headline is ink. A yellow accent on a light ground is a fill under dark text only (the button,
one block); links and small marks on that page take the ink, since a yellow line does not read there.
The same holds for any accent under 3:1 on its ground (brass on paper grey, lime on pink): the sheet
says so under the palette's note.

## 4. Surfaces without lines or shadows

With rules and shadows banned, a surface is told apart from the ground by tone alone:

```css
.panel { background: var(--surface); }          /* 6–9 lightness points from --bg, 7.5–10.5 on dark */
.field { background: var(--surface); border: 0; } /* inputs: filled, with a clear focus state */
.field:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }
```

- The surface is a real step, so cards, panels, the bar's panel and the footer read as groups in a
  screenshot. A step under 4 points (#ebebeb on #f7f7f7, mint on a paler mint, sand a notch off sand)
  reads as a faint grey-on-grey box. Past about 9 points (11 on dark) the surface turns into a grey
  slab or a second colour. Use `--surface` as dealt: never soften it with opacity or a mix toward the
  ground, and never put it back near the ground for a "subtle" card.
- Two grounds: the page ground and its one surface. A dealt field is a band in the ink or the
  accent for one section at most. Nothing else grounds a section, a card or a panel: no tint between
  the two, no colour per section, no new tone for cards that overlap or stack (they take the surface
  and the ink in turn). A portfolio page that used seven grounds and panels read as sprawl; a sheet
  or card in a colour the sheet did not deal, a white receipt on a grey page, is one more. The
  inspector counts every ground by the screens a visitor sees it on: the page ground and its
  surface, the ink and a dealt field once they ground more than the footer and one section (or two
  and a half screens), the accent past one section, and any other tone, a band sampled from a
  photograph included. Three warn, four fail; a ground the dealt scene or technique asks for is named
  and only warns (`surface-count`). Where a palette's note names more grounds, the sheet's tokens
  win.
- Do not nest a panel inside a panel.
- Images do not need a frame. If a light photograph melts into a light ground, change the crop or set
  it on `--surface`, do not outline it.
- A thick bar (4px or more) in ink or accent is a graphic element, allowed where the direction uses
  it. A 1px line is not.

## 5. Colour fields

A section that changes the whole ground colour is the strongest colour move available, and it replaces
dividers, cards and background decoration at once. On a page it is the band the sheet deals: the ink
or the accent, one section at most each (§4), never a colour of its own.

- A band meets the sections beside it edge to edge with a hard line. Nothing fades.
- Every field has its own assigned ink from the palette. Never put `--muted` on a coloured field; use
  the field's ink at full strength, or at 70% opacity for secondary text if it still passes contrast.
- A band differs from its neighbours in lightness, not only in hue, or the page vibrates.
- Put it where the page needs its one strong break (a figure, a statement, the close), never two
  bands side by side.
- The page's meta theme colour and the navigation follow the ground of the first screen.

## 6. Dark pages

- Put `color-scheme: dark` on the root so form controls and scrollbars follow.
- The ground is a deep tone with a slight tint from the palette, and the ink is a soft light, not
  `#fff` on `#000`, unless the palette deals exactly that for a stark two-tone direction.
- Secondary text is where dark pages fail: check `--muted` against the ground and the surface
  (4.5:1).
- Depth on dark comes from a lighter surface step, never from glows or coloured light.
- Use lighter font weights than you would on a light page.

## 7. Colour and photographs

- When photographs carry the colour, the interface stays neutral and takes its ink from the darkest
  tone in the imagery.
- Do not wash a photograph with the brand colour. Leave it alone, or give every image on the page one
  real treatment (section 0 deals it). Pictures stay in colour unless the brief asks for black and
  white: a stand-in whose file is black-and-white is left out, the client's own pictures are shown as
  they are (references/imagery.md §6).
- Text over a photograph needs a calm region. If there is none, move the text off the image. No
  gradient over a picture, no milky or dark fade (the inspector fails it): at most a flat dark scrim,
  black at 40–55%, over the text area only, on a dark page as on a light one (a pale ink scrim reads
  as fog).
- A section sits with its photograph when the band beside it is the ink or the accent the picture
  already holds; never a new field sampled from a photograph (its sky, its shadow) unless the dealt
  scene asks for one: that is a third ground (`surface-count`).

## 8. Contrast

- Body text 4.5:1 or better; display type and large numerals 3:1 or better; the dealt palettes meet
  7:1 for ink on ground.
- `inspect.mjs` computes contrast for text on flat grounds and fails anything under 2.6:1. It cannot
  see text over photographs: check those in the screenshots yourself.
- Do not lower opacity on text to make it "soft" unless you have checked the resulting ratio.
- Focus states and hover states increase contrast, never reduce it.

## 9. Banned families, and what "warm" means here

The inspector fails these:

- **Cream with terracotta.** A yellow-cream ground (roughly hue 22–62, light and noticeably
  saturated) with a rust, clay or burnt-orange accent is the house look of AI assistants and of the
  pages they generate. Either half alone is suspect; together they are unmistakable.
- **Violet, indigo, lavender and periwinkle.** The first wave of generated pages was purple; it still
  reads that way. A blue lightened for a dark ground drifts into periwinkle (a notes app's cobalt came
  out as #76a4fe, and its judge named it): lighten a blue toward its cyan side, a sky blue, or take
  another accent. The draw turns any accent or field in that range to its cyan side.

If the brief wants warmth, get it from a low-chroma stone, bone or putty ground (saturation under
about 15%), from a deep green, brown or oxblood ink, from photographs, or from a full warm field
(mustard, tomato red, pink) used flat and with conviction. Warmth is not beige.

If the brand itself owns one of the banned colours, it is the brand's and you keep it: use
`--keep palette`, pass `--allow palette-purple` (or the relevant rule) to the inspector, and note it in
the report.
