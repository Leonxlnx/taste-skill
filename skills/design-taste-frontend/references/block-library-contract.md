# Block Library Contract

Referenced from `SKILL.md` Section 12. Load this only when you are **adding a
block to the library** - it is a contributor schema, not something the agent
needs in context to build a page.

**Status:** schema defined, no blocks implemented yet. `blocks/` does not exist
in this repo. Until the first block lands, treat Section 10 (Reference
Vocabulary) as the source of pattern names.

---

The Reference Vocabulary (Section 10) names patterns. The Block Library implements them with real props, real motion specs, and real code sketches.

**Status:** schema defined here. Blocks will be added iteratively. Do not freelance new blocks without following this schema.

### 12.A File Location
```
skills/design-taste-frontend/blocks/
  hero/
    asymmetric-split.md
    editorial-manifesto.md
    kinetic-type.md
    ...
  feature/
    bento-grid.md

    zig-zag.md

### 12.B Required Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: asymmetric-split-hero
category: hero
dial_compatibility:
  variance: [6, 10]
  motion: [3, 10]
  density: [2, 5]
when_to_use: "Landing pages with one strong asset and one strong message. Default hero for SaaS, agency, premium consumer."
not_for: "Editorial / manifesto launches where the message IS the design."
stack: ["react", "next", "tailwind", "motion"]
---
```

### 12.C Required Body Sections
1. **Visual sketch** - short ASCII or description of the layout.
2. **Props API** - the component's interface.
3. **Code sketch** - minimal working implementation (Server Component default, Client island for motion).
4. **Mobile fallback** - explicit collapse rules for `< 768px`.
5. **Motion variants** - one variant per `MOTION_INTENSITY` band (1-3, 4-7, 8-10). Reduced-motion fallback explicit.
6. **Dark-mode notes** - token strategy specific to this block.
7. **Anti-patterns** - common ways this block goes wrong.
8. **References** - links to real examples in production.

### 12.D Block-Library Discipline
* One block per file. No multi-block files.
* Every block must work standalone (drop it into a page, it renders).
* Every block must pass the Pre-Flight Check (Section 14).
* Blocks that depend on a design system from Section 2.A live under `blocks/<category>/<name>--<system>.md` (e.g. `feature/bento-grid--material.md`).
